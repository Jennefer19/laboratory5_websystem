    <p>True love these days can be found in a lot of creative places—online, at a bar, or the old-fashioned way, on a blind date. But to a true coffee lover, the <br> relationship they want and need is found every morning (noon and night, sometimes!) at the bottom of their favorite mug. Black, cream, sugar, foam, no <br> foam, these preferences could easily divide nations, it seems, because people LOVE their coffee a certain and often will not budge on changing it. <br> Growing up in Seattle, where Starbucks is the Mothership, and craft coffee shops are found on every corner, I grew up thinking coffee and coffee culture <br> was a normal way of life. But for many people, coffee is just what gets you going in the morning. You fill up your trusty thermos or travel mug with <br> whatever you’ve got ground up or in a pod and you’re off for the day. So if that’s you, and you’d like to experience a deeper affinity and appreciation <br> for one of God’s finest beverages, then look no further than these quotes. And if you’re on the hunt for what to buy your coffee-crazed friend or <br> family member, look no further than our coffee lover gift guide!</p>
